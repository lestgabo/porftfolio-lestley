_Me and the Aztec water goddess Chalchiuhtlicue (Chal-CHEE-ooh-tlee-quay)._  
_Our Teotihuacan tour guide said an original water god statue was in the Mexican national museum. I found her! I found the world destroyer._

The goddess ruled over and destroyed the previous world, known in Aztec mythology as the Fourth Sun.
After 676 years, Chalchiutlicue destroyed that world in a cataclysmic flood.
The current world is the Fifth Sun based on the Aztec universe. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/chalchiuhtlicue-goddess-170327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

The goddes and I are two opposites. Yin and yang. Good and bad.
I create websites. Applications. Software. Worlds.
I create worlds. While Chalchiuhtlicue destroys them.
We don't belong together, but we are a balance.

I have made several projects with Ruby on Rails.
But recently, I have focused a lot on React development.
To make my frontend development easier, I always use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Ant Design and Material UI.
I keep my hosting simple by uploading my backend to Heroku and uploading my frontend to Netlify.

I don't see coding as a job. To me, coding is my passion and my career.
Coding, coding, coding. It's just something I do.
I code because it makes me feel like I am the best.
I have tons of ideas and bringing them to life would be an adventure full of learning.
